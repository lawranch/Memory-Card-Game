# Memory-Card-Game
This memory card game was created from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to make 3D flipping animations through the use of CSS. Additionally, I practice code refactoring to give the JavaScript code a cleaner look, allowing people to easily understand it and add to it if needed.
